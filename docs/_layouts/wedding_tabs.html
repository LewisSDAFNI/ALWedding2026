            <p>Annette and Lewis will officially be married on <span style="color:red;font-weight:700">October
                    31st</span>, in Plymouth registry office. There is a very tight limit on the number of witnesses to
                this service and we apologies for anyone who *really* wanted to watch a stern legal reading and Lewis
                attempting to remember how to use a pen. <br />

                There will be a small gathering and laid back lunch following this service and then Annette will be able
                to start panic-planning all the last minutes things we needed. We will reach out seperately to people to
                let them know about the service and lunch, but we invite others to look forward to the exciting cermony
                and free food the following day.</p>
