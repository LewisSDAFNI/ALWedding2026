                There will be a small gathering and laid back lunch following this service and then Annette will be able
                to start panic-planning all the last minutes things we <sup>needed</sup>. We will reach out seperately
                to people to
                let them know about the service and lunch, but look forward to celebrating with you all the following
                day.</p>
