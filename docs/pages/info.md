### Registry Office
Annette and Lewis will officially be married on <span style="color:red;font-weight:700">October 31st</span>, in Plymouth registry office. There is a very tight limit on the number of witnesses to this service and we apologies for anyone who *really* wanted to watch a stern legal reading and Lewis attempting to remember how to use a pen. 

There will be a small gathering and laid back lunch following this service and then Annette will be able to start panic-planning all the last minutes things we needed. We will reach out seperately to people to let them know about the service and lunch, but we invite others to look forward to the exciting cermony and free food the following day.
