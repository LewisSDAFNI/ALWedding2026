### Thank you, but...
We have already built our lives in our castle with Cosmo our familiar. We dont need a third casserole dish, or an extra option for how we serve Tea. We both want this wedding to be more about spending time together and celebrating with our loved ones, rather than gifts.

Instead, we would appreciate a donation to Stroke Association, Cancer Research, or Dementia Awareness, all are close to our hearts. Please let us know of any donations so that we thank you for your support.

Alternatively, there will be an online Honeymoon Fund and a collection box on the day. If you would really prefer to help us pay for a Honeymoon in 2027, then check this page closer to the date for the link to the Fund.
